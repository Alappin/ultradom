Ultradom is a minimal (1 kB) view layer for building declarative web user interfaces. Mix it with your favorite state management solution or use it standalone for maximum flexibility.

What's in the bundle? A virtual DOM and diff algorithm, keyed-based node [reconciliation](#keys), element-level [lifecycle](#lifecycle-events) events and browser support all the way back to IE9.

## Installation

<pre>
npm i <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/ultradom>ultradom</a>
</pre>

Don't want to set up a build environment? Download Ultradom from a CDN such as [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/ultradom) and it will be globally available through the <samp>window.ultradom</samp> object.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ultradom"></script>
```

## Getting Started

Let's walkthrough a simple ticking clock. You can [try it online](https://codepen.io/jorgebucaran/pen/LdLJXX?editors=0010) to see what it looks like.

```js
import { h, render } from "ultradom"

setInterval(
  () =>
    render(
      h("div", {}, [
        h("h1", {}, "Hello World!"),
        h("h2", {}, `The time is: ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`)
      ]),
      document.body
    ),
  1000
)
```

Ultradom consists of a two-function API. <samp>ultradom.h</samp> creates a new virtual DOM node and <samp>ultradom.render</samp> renders it into the supplied container.

A virtual DOM is a description of what a DOM should look like using a tree of nested JavaScript objects known as virtual nodes. Think of it as a lightweight representation of the DOM.

```jsx
{
  name: "div",
  attributes: {},
  children: [
    {
      name: "h1",
      attributes: {},
      children: "Hello World!"
    },
    {
      name: "h2",
      attributes: {},
      children: `The time is: ${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}`
    }
  ]
}
```

The virtual DOM allows us to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt every time we render a node, while we only update the parts of the DOM that actually changed.

We try to do this in the least number of steps possible, by comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one. This leads to high efficiency, since typically only a small percentage of nodes need to change, and changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM.

### JSX

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is an optional language syntax extension that lets you write HTML tags interspersed with JavaScript. Because browsers don't understand JSX, we use a compiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to transform it into <samp>ultradom.h</samp> function calls.

```jsx
import { h, render } from "ultradom"

setInterval(
  () =>
    render(
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>The time is: {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>
      </div>,
      document.body
    ),
  1000
)
```

To get up and running with JSX install the JSX [transform plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx) and add the pragma option to your <samp>.babelrc</samp> file.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "transform-react-jsx",
      {
        "pragma": "h"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

#### Component Syntax

Ultradom does not support the JSX component syntax out of the box, but you can wrap <samp>ultradom.h</samp> in a function that adds this functionality.

```jsx
import * as ultradom from "ultradom"

const h = (name, attributes, ...children) => {
  return typeof name === "function"
    ? name(attributes, children)
    : ultradom.h(name, attributes, children)
}

const Clock = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>The time is: {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>
  </div>
)

setInterval(() => ultradom.render(<Clock />, document.body), 1000)
```

## Supported Attributes

* [HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)
* [SVG attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute)
* [DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
* [Styles](#styles)
* [Lifecycle Events](#lifecycle-events)
* [Keys](#keys)

### Styles

The <samp>style</samp> attribute expects a plain object rather than a string as in HTML.
Each declaration consists of a style name property written in <samp>camelCase</samp> and a value. CSS variables are also supported.

Individual style properties will be diffed and mapped against <samp>[style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style)</samp> property members of the DOM element â€” you should therefore use the JavaScript style object [property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), e.g. <samp>backgroundColor</samp> rather than <samp>background-color</samp>.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const Jumbotron = text =>
  h(
    "div",
    {
      style: {
        color: "white",
        fontSize: "32px",
        textAlign: center,
        backgroundImage: `url(${imgUrl})`
      }
    },
    text
  )
```

### Lifecycle Events

You can be notified when elements managed by the virtual DOM are created, updated or removed via lifecycle events. Use them for animation, wrapping third party libraries, cleaning up resources, etc.

#### oncreate

This event is fired after the element is created and attached to the DOM. Use it to manipulate the DOM node directly, make a network request, create a slide/fade in animation, etc.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const Textbox = placeholder =>
  h("input", {
    type: "text",
    placeholder,
    oncreate: element => element.focus()
  })
```

#### onupdate

This event is fired every time we update the element attributes. Use <samp>oldAttributes</samp> inside the event handler to check if any attributes changed or not.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const Textbox = placeholder =>
  h("input", {
    type: "text",
    placeholder,
    onupdate: (element, oldAttributes) => {
      if (oldAttributes.placeholder !== placeholder) {
        // Handle changes here!
      }
    }
  })
```

#### onremove

This event is fired before the element is removed from the DOM. Use it to create slide/fade out animations. Call <samp>done</samp> inside the function to remove the element. This event is not called in its child elements.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const MessageWithFadeout = title =>
  h("div", { onremove: (element, done) => fadeout(element).then(done) }, [
    h("h1", {}, title)
  ])
```

#### ondestroy

This event is fired after the element has been removed from the DOM, either directly or as a result of a parent being removed. Use it for invalidating timers, canceling a network request, removing global events listeners, etc.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const Camera = onerror =>
  h("video", {
    poster: "loading.png",
    oncreate: element => {
      navigator.mediaDevices
        .getUserMedia({ video: true })
        .then(stream => (element.srcObject = stream))
        .catch(onerror)
    },
    ondestroy: element => element.srcObject.getTracks()[0].stop()
  })
```

### Keys

Keys helps identify nodes every time we update the DOM. By setting the <samp>key</samp> property on a virtual node, you declare that the node should correspond to a particular DOM element. This allow us to re-order the element into its new position, if the position changed, rather than risk destroying it. Note that keys must be unique among sibling-nodes.

```jsx
import { h } from "ultradom"

export const ImageGallery = images =>
  images.map(({ hash, url, description }) =>
    h("li", { key: hash }, [
      h("img", {
        src: url,
        alt: description
      })
    ])
  )
```
